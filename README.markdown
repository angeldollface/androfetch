# ANDROFETCH :robot: :gear:

***A neofetch-like app for Android. :robot: :gear:***

## ABOUT :books:

Since I recently got a Pixel device and love to tinker with my devices and wanted to learn about Android development the *Android* way, I wanted to write a small app.
Since I'm used to running *Neofetch* on nearly all my devices, I thought it would be cool to have an app that serves a similar purpose. This repository contains the source code for this app. 
I learned a lot and learned how to program in Java. Enjoy. :heart:
